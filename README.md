## Driving in a Square

1. High-Level Description

This subproject drives the turtlebot in a square. I use a loop that iterates four times to complete this behavior, and, for each iteration, I let the robot go straight for couple seconds (i.e., with linear velocity and without angular velocity) and then make a 90-degree turn for couple seconds (i.e., without linear velocity and with angular velocity). After the fourth iteration, I set both linear and angular velocity to 0 to stop the robot.
